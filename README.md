# RuneClock

RuneClock is a general-purpose Discord bot for RuneScape Discord servers, originally written for the [Portables Discord server](https://discord.gg/QhBCYYr).

## Usage

* Invite the bot to your server using the following link: [invite](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=449462150491275274&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands). Replace the permission number in the url if you want to invite the bot with different permissions.
* When the bot is joined to your server, the default command prefix will be a dash ("-"). You can change this prefix using the `prefix` command.
* For any further information regarding commands, please use the `help` command.
