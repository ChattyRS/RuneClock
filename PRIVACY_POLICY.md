## Privacy statement

We respect the privacy of your information. We provide this explanation about our information practices as a show of our commitment to protect your privacy.

Your continued use of this bot after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

## The information we collect and how we collect it

### User info

Your user info is stored if and only if explicitly requested by you through the `setrsn`, `set07rsn`, or `settimezone` commands.
This user info can be removed by using the same command again without any arguments / data.

For example, when you use the command `@RuneClock setrsn USERNAME`, RuneClock stores the string `USERNAME` under your Discord user ID.
You can have this data deleted at any time as follows: `@RuneClock setrsn`.

### User-generated content

User-generated content (part of your message) may be temporarily stored only when any of the following features is used:

* Polls, until the poll has expired (max 1 week) or is closed by the user
* Custom commands, until the custom command is removed by the user or RuneClock is removed from your server
* Custom notifications, until the time of the notification, or when the notification is cancelled by the user, or RuneClock is removed from your server

Note that (part of) your message content is *only* stored when the message in question creates one of the above objects.

For example, when you create a custom notification as follows: `@RuneClock addnotification #your-notification-channel 22:00 0 Time for a raid!`,
RuneClock stores the string `Time for a raid!` until 22:00 on the same day, or until you use the `removenotification` command to cancel it, or until you remove RuneClock from your Discord server.

## The way we use information

We use information that you provide to us:

* To fulfill the purpose of the command / feature for which you provide it.
* In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.

## Disclosure of your information

We will never disclose any of your information to any third party unless required by law.

## Changes to our privacy policy

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. 
The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. 
If information has been collected, you are responsible for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.
